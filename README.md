# Rechord

ADC_Controller2 - code for controlling 1 ADC0848 chip with multiplexing. Use this to test individual chips
ADC_Controller4 - code for controlling 3 ADC0848 chips with multiplexing. Use this to test 3 chips working in harmony
Arduino_Interface2(not yet tested) - code for controlling the chips to digitize the signal. This uses interrupts and faster versions of pinMode and digitalWrite/Read to shorten the execution time of each loop cycle which translates to faster sampling time.
